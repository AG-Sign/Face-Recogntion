# Face-Recogntion

•We intend to perform face recognition. Face recognition means that for a given
image you can tell the subject id. Our database of subject is very simple. It has 40
subjects

•The dataset has 10 images per 40 subjects. Every image is a grayscale
image of size 92x112

•For the rest of details look up our report attached [Report](https://github.com/AG-Sign/Face-Recogntion/blob/main/Face_Recognition_Report.pdf)
